## Performance-oriented data structures for Kotlin

A collection of performance-oriented data structures providing performance and efficiency that might appear to be
impossible at first glance.

If you find this library useful, please consider giving it
a [![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/daniel-rusu/pods4k?label=Star)](https://github.com/daniel-rusu/pods4k)
on [GitHub](https://github.com/daniel-rusu/pods4k) and sharing it with others.

## Installation

[![Latest Version][maven-central-shield]][maven-central-url] available on Maven Central:

**Gradle:**

```kotlin
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}
dependencies {
    implementation("com.danrusu.pods4k:pods4k:0.6.0")
}
```

**Maven:**

```xml

<dependency>
    <groupId>com.danrusu.pods4k</groupId>
    <artifactId>pods4k</artifactId>
    <version>0.6.0</version>
</dependency>
```

Alternatively, you can [pick & choose](publishing/bom/README.md) individual components of this library.

## Immutable Arrays

[Immutable Arrays](immutable-arrays/README.md) offer a safer, faster, and more efficient alternative to lists while
maintaining familiar syntax.

#### Key Benefits

* ![Fast][fast-shield] [2 to 8 times faster than lists](immutable-arrays/BENCHMARKS.md) for most operations.
* ![Efficient][efficient-shield] [Over 4X memory reduction](immutable-arrays/README.md#-efficiency) in many common
  scenarios.
* ![Immutable][immutable-shield] Cannot be modified, even with casting.
* ![Type Safe][type-safe-shield] Prevents accidental mutation attempts at compile time.
* ![Efficient Builders][efficient-builders-shield] Gather elements more efficiently than mutable lists.

#### Intuitive list-like syntax

```kotlin
val people = immutableArrayOf(dan, jill, bobby)

// Iterate naturally
for (person in people) {
    sendMarketingEmailTo(person)
}
// All the usual operations
val employedPeople = people.filter { it.isEmployed() }
val salaries = employedPeople.map { it.salary }
```

See [Immutable Arrays](immutable-arrays/README.md) for more specifics along with detailed comparisons against regular
arrays, read-only lists, and immutable lists.

## Minimum Requirements

* Kotlin 1.9.25
    * This library is K2 compatible as it's used in other projects that use Kotlin 2.1 etc.
* JDK 11
    * Automated tests are run on JDK LTS releases 11, 17, & 21

## Java Compatibility

Some data structures use techniques which are only supported by the Kotlin compiler. While they can be used in a mixed
Java & Kotlin codebase to store one of these data structures in a Java-defined collection, referencing these data
structures by their class name is only supported within Kotlin files.
