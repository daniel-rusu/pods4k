        Given a `people` Immutable Array, performing an action on each element currently looks like this:
        ```kotlin
          for (person in people) {
            sendMarketingEmailTo(person)
          }
        ```
        
        A `forEach` method would make this cleaner:
        ```kotlin
          people.forEach { sendMarketingEmailTo(it) }
        ```
